# Blackjack-Game
My Python project on Jupyter Notebook is an interactive implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, where players can play against a computer dealer, aiming to reach 21 without busting.
In this Python project developed on Jupyter Notebook, I have created an engaging and interactive version of the timeless card game Blackjack. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino game where players aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. It's a thrilling game that combines elements of strategy, probability, and luck.

The project features a user-friendly interface that allows players to interact with the game through their inputs. Players are dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. The computer dealer also follows a set of rules for playing its hand, making the game feel authentic and challenging.

To create this project, I utilized Python's fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. I implemented a deck of cards using lists and dictionaries and implemented logic to calculate card values, considering the complexities of handling aces' dual values. Error handling ensures that players input valid choices, and the game's flow maintains proper turn-taking between the player and the dealer.

Throughout the game, the player's current hand and score are displayed, enhancing the gameplay experience. After each round, the game allows players to continue or exit gracefully.

By building this Python project on Blackjack, I have honed my programming skills and gained a deeper understanding of data structures, logic implementation, and user interaction. Players can now enjoy the excitement of Blackjack anytime and anywhere with this well-crafted digital version.
